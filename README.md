This repository demonstrates the end-to-end process of performing ET (Extract, Transform) operations and data analysis using Power BI. The project focuses on leveraging Power BI's capabilities to extract data from various sources, clean and transform it using Power Query Editor, and visualize insights through interactive dashboards.
Key highlights of this project include:

Extract: Pull data from multiple sources such as Excel, CSV, and databases.
Transform: Clean and process raw data, including removing duplicates, renaming columns, handling missing values, and applying calculated transformations.
Load: Import the cleaned and transformed data into Power BI for further analysis.
Data Modeling: Create relationships between tables and define data hierarchies for detailed drill-down analysis.
Visualizations: Build interactive dashboards using various visualization types, including bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and slicers.
