Exhaustive Analysis of Indian Agriculture using Power BI

This repository presents an in-depth analysis of Indian agriculture, utilizing Power BI to explore key datasets and uncover actionable insights. It demonstrates the application of ET(Extract, Transform) processes and advanced data visualization techniques to address critical aspects of the agricultural sector.

Key Highlights:

Extract: Data is sourced from government reports, CSV files, and publicly available datasets covering crop production, rainfall patterns, soil quality, and market trends.

Transform: Using Power Query Editor, the data is cleaned, processed, and optimized by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing fields for consistency.

Load: Processed datasets are loaded into Power BI, ensuring a structured foundation for analysis.
